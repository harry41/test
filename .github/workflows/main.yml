name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  schedule:
    # * is a special character in YAML so you have to quote this string
    - cron:  '*/50 * * * *'
  #Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
